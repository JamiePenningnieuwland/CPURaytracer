# MyRaytracer
This project was made by me in year 1 of my education at BUAS. It is a cpu raytracer which implements various features. 

how to use:

1. download zip
2. unzip in chosen folder
3. open solution file and run project using visual studio

Made with 3dgep template https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/

Features:
- Controllable camera (WASD, Space, shift)
- In house maths
- Unit testing
- hdr skybox
- Multithreading (different options)
